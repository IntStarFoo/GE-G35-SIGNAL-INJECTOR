GE-G35-SIGNAL-INJECTOR
======================

A board layout that enables an easy process for tapping into the POWER, GROUND, SIGNAL wires in a GE G35 LED light set.  The goal is to create a simple, safe and switchable link between the original signal a new signal produced by whatever proc is plugged in.  And Stuff.

I give no guarantees of safety or function.  Use at your own risk.
